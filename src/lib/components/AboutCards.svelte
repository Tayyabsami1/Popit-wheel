    </h2>
    <p class="mt-2">
      To generate a random spin result the website uses a JavaScript programming
      language method Crypto.getRandomValues() under the hood (where available;
      in some old browsers Math.random() is used). The Crypto.getRandomValues()
      method lets us get cryptographically strong random values. To guarantee
      enough performance, the implementation is not using a truly random number
      generator, but it is using a pseudo-random number generator seeded with a
      value with enough entropy. The pseudo-random number generator algorithm
      (PRNG) may vary across browsers, but is suitable for cryptographic
      purposes, therefore, we believe it is good enough for our spin wheel use
      case.
